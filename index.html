                Hi, I'm Svjetlana, journalist
            </h1>
            <p>
                I am a graduated journalist and a beginner web developer. I live in Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
            </p>
            <p>
                From 2009, until 2019 (with minor interruptions) I worked for national television RTRS - as a TV journalist.
            </p>    
            <p>    
                I wrote articles for the media and portals: Nezavisne novine, Prosvetni pregled, BUKA, Efm ..
                I worked on the project CCi and USAID TV show "BAR CODE", on consumer protection in Bosnia. Participated in the realization of the project Media Center Sarajevo.
            </p>    
            <p>    
                I graduated at the Faculty of Political Science in Banja Luka - Department of Journalism.
            </p>    
            <p>    
                I like to read, write and travel.

                And future front-end developer
            </h1>
            <p>
                Through the work of a journalist, I learned that certain stages of work are necessary for the story. From recording, text writing to editing.
                I liked the same thing in programming, the road from an idea to its realization. 
            <p> 
                From writing HTML, adding CSS, to adding functionality with JavaScript.
                On the journey through web development, to it becoming my job, there is a long road ahead.
            <p>    
                The plan is to write down the learning process on this site to help someone who will start tomorrow as I did. From daily tasks, courses I took, reading literature, to things that took me more time, and things you don't need to waste time with. 
            </p>
            <p>  
                Goal: Connect these two passions to work.
